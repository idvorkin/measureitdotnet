// Here is a table of contents of this solution
//
// This solution is designed an example for measuring performance of managed
// code.
//
// * file:MeasureIt.cs - Code that creates simple examples of
//     runtime features and measures their performance (This is the Main
//     program). This is a good place to start.
//     
// * file:PerformanceMeasurement.cs - Code that provides supprot to accumulate
//     the results of many performance runs and to create a HTML report.
//     
// * file:CodeTimers.cs - Stand-alone code that makes it easy to measure the
//     time it takes a fragment of code to run.
//    
// * file:ComputerSpecs.cs - Stand-alone code that gather the important
//     characteristics of the current computer (CPU speed, Disk, etc).
// 
// * file:UsersGuide.htm - This is the source code for the users's guide. If
//     you just want to browse it, be sure to click the 'Design' view (in the
//     lower left hand corner) so you are not viewing the source.

/* Benign warnings during the build! */
// There warnings about not being able to add a like to various source files.
// These warnings are an artifact of the way I embed the source into the
